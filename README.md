# Gesture-recognition-based-on-virtual-mouse-and-keyboard
The code above implements a hand gesture-based keyboard using OpenCV, a computer vision toolkit, and NumPy, a numerical computing package.
It is a virtual keyboard that may be used to type text using hand motions collected by the webcam. Hand motions are identified using the 
HandTracker class, which can identify hands in real-time and track their landmarks.The keyboard has 26 letters, a clear button, a backspace button, 
a space button, and a text box to show the written text. To show and leave the keyboard, 
mouse events such as mouse motion and mouse click are also incorporated. 
The algorithm also computes frames per second (FPS) to assess keyboard performance.
